# Introduction

This a sinatra application that plays the classic game of Lights Out on a 6x6 grid via your browser. This is just the gameplay part of my other version converted to use [HTRB](https://github.com/Christopher-R-Perkins/htrb) and HTMX for AJAX calls.

While I do not have this version live, I do have a modified version based on this one and the [original](https://github.com/Christopher-R-Perkins/blink-out) live at [https://blink.quasari.dev](https://blink.quasari.dev)
